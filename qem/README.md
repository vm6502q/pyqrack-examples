# Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM)

This folder contains examples of _mitigating_ error from Qrack's approximate simulation techniques with _[Mitiq](https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)._ (Error _"mitigation,"_ as opposed to error _"correction,"_ scales infeasibly for large circuit sizes but achieves accuracy gain in near-term, for small scales, while practical quantum error correction is a _scalable_ technique that remains largely beyond frontier capability, circa 2025.)
