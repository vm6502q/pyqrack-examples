# Out-of-Time-Order Correlation (OTOC)

Google Quantum AI published on in 2025 on [OTOC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09526-6), claiming potential "quantum advantage." Basically, the idea is to use the _reversibility_ of gate-based quantum computers to model physical time reversal symmetry of thermodynamic systems, for example, at the level of a fine-grained quantum mechanical system, as well as how this symmetry is broken. Google used a circuit and its time reversal that seems to resemble _random circuit sampling,_ and this case is handled with Qrack's _automatic circuit elision (ACE)_ to high cross-entropy benchmark fidelity on very deep and wide circuits. (To validate, try setting environment variable `QRACK_MAX_PAGING_QB` to 1/2 or 1/4 of your overall count of qubits in the benchmark, to model the case instead as 2 or 4 independent subsystems that couple between each other only semi-classically.) Alternatively, we could argue that the "real point" of OTOC is _thermodynamic_ reversibility, like with _transverse field ising model (TFIM),_ rather than RCS. With `pyqrackising`, we show that low or moderate "scrambling" returns high fidelity, while highly scrambled circuits, on TFIM, are best described in practicality by simply their mean field, to within a tiny margin, making us doubt whether this case could constitute true "advantage" for any practical purpose.
