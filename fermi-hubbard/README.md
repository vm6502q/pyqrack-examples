# Fermi-Hubbard model

Following after our earlier work on _Transverse field Ising model (TFIM),_ this folder explores _Fermi-Hubbard model,_ describing the transition between conducting and insulating systems. [Fermi-Hubbard was held up by Quantinuum as another potential case of "quantum advantage" in 2025.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02125) For a simple model, we find that L2 norm root-sum-square difference of measurement distributions is below 1% by 16 qubits and decreasing with increased qubit width, for non-equilibrium cases. However, XEB and agreement with Trotterized magnetization curves decreases quickly. This might capture a low-order model, as the distributions are non-equilibrium with high and growing variance explained with qubit width. However, this model might not capture point-to-point entaglement correlations. (A low-order or mean-field model is still potentially very useful, despite lack of sensitivity to quantum entanglement correlations.)
