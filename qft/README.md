# Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The _[Quantum Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform)_ is a standard and important "building-block" algorithm of other quantum algorithms, like Shor's integer factoring algorithm. The QFT on a quantum computer is analogous to the (inverse) _discrete Fourier transform (DFT)_ or _fast Fourier transform (FFT)_ on a classical computer.

The Qrack project was fascinated by the QFT, for a time, for its potential applications to "quantum circuit cosmology," and for how the relevant case studied could be _classically efficient_ to simulate. We also explored, informally, the potential conceptual connection between the QFT and a transformation from minimal entropy to _maximum entanglement entropy_ in black-hole thermodynamics.
