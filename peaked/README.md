# Peaked Circuits

_Peaked circuits_ for quantum computers were proposed by Scott Aaronson. The basic idea is that most useful problems in computer science tends to converge on a single **specific** answer, not a noisy distribution tail, so quantum computers should probably find application to circuits with sharply peaked probability on one or a small number of specific amplitudes. Examples of such circuits can be found at [BlueQubit's site](https://www.bluequbit.io/), particularly recent hackathons.
