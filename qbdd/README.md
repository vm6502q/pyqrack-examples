# Quantum Binary Decision Diagrams (QBDD)

The scripts in this folder demonstrate Qrack's _quantum binary decision diagram (QBDD)_ capabilities, as a (CPU-only) simulation method alternative alongside state vector and Clifford stabilizer methods (with or without Schmidt decomposition and JIT circuit simplification.) Qrack's version of QBDD is a _homomorphically compressed_ representation of general universal pure quantum states, most appropriate for states with "low-entanglement" or little superposition. ("Low-entanglement" is an ambiguous and context-specific term, but, in this case, we basically mean complicated nonlocal conditional dependence of many respective qubits upon each other's states, such that QBDD "tree" representation is incompressible: a GHZ state would qualify as "low-entanglement" in this case, because the QBDD tree would only contain two branches without dependence on the number of qubits in the state. Maximal superposition by acting `H` across all qubits in |0> state would similarly redundantly compress to one branch, despite all amplitudes being nonzero.)

See [Decision Diagrams for Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04687) for an introduction (and please consider citing those authors, on QBDD).
