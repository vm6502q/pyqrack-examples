# Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)

_Transverse field Ising model (TFIM)_ is a quantum thermodynamic model of spin magnetism in solids. (In slightly simpler terms, for example, when a bar magnet has a net magnetic field "at rest," it should be possible in theory to model this as the TFIM "ground state" of attraction between magnetic electron spins in its solid material.) TFIM is at the core of almost all realized cases of algorithmic "quantum advantage" of quantum algorithms over classical ones (as of 2025), besides _Shor's integer-factoring algorithm_ and _Grover's search algorithm._ Despite popular perception of this problem as being categorically hard for classical simulation, with `PyQrackIsing`, Qrack can approximate global properties TFIM well (like net magnetization in a surface) for hundreds of qubits and dozens of "Trotter steps" (i.e., "circuit layers," basically) on almost any contemporary desktop or laptop. ([`ising_ace_depth_series.py`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack-examples/blob/main/ising/ising_depth_series.py) will produce square-magnetization curves over a series of Trotter steps, and [`ising_ace_validation.py`](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack-examples/blob/main/ising/ising_ace_validation.py) will validate the same experimental parameters at smaller scales that can be compared to ideal Qiskit Aer simulation. See also [Digital quantum magnetism at the frontier of classical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20870) for comparison to state-of-the-art in quantum hardware running TFIM.)
