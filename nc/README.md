# Near-Clifford (NC)

_Near-Clifford_ simulation is suitable for circuits that are almost entirely amenable to stabilizer simulation (like via [CHP](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196)) but contain a small number of non-Clifford gates (such as `T` or `RZ`, usually). Qrack offers its own novel and original near-Clifford simulation technique for [Clifford+RZ] gate set.
