Got internship while completing Masters
QC Since 2021

Project and why?
Flight trajectory optimization
- Debut in quantum, first paid project
- Other work was hackathons, take a day to get it to work in a basic way
- Project was concentrated effort over 3 years
- Entirely led by Henry
- Most significant
- From technical side: classical + quantum
- Modifies a classical algorithm and "hybridizes" with Grover

Research result and importance?
- Binary priority queue: fundamental performance in big-O complexity
- Combined with Grover's

Formal presentation:
- Find most efficient trajectory while satisfying constraints (weather, fuel, regulations)
- Optimal vs. non-optimal control
- Chose non-optimal (graph-based): Aircraft models -> Kinematic / kinetic -> Dijkstra
- Shortest graph, 4 nodes per layer, 7 layers in example
- Fuel can't be known analytically; dynamic input
- Design a sufficiently complex toy model without over complicating
- Pulled aircraft data and flight path data from various APIs
- Converted to 3D space
- Peturbed in 3D space with ascent/descent profile, to create network of potential paths
- Omitted turbulence
- Step-wise recalculate mass/weight

Critical (good) decision:
- Approaching the problem like a mathematician
- Catering to the audience
- Needed to familiarize self with aerospace industry as "insider" would see it.

Critical (bad) decision:
- Meant a lot because of family background in industry
- Regretted the fact that this was an experimental project, not yet to be used
- Spent significant consideration and time on fulcrum-point algorithm: partition graphs to terminate at "fulcrum points" and run Grover's on each
- Might have improved the algorithm to the point of being (immediately) adopted
- Upon reconsideration: could have colloborated more with other industry professionals in aerospace
- Felt he would be dismissed as an early career researcher (but he should have tried, in retrospect).

Teamwork:
- Work was done 100% remote
- Team is in Chicago; candidate it a permanent Montreal resident
- Third author is candidate's mentor in bridging academia and industry, thesis advisor
- Worked together in startup environment
- Did well through solo progresss, colloborated with coauthors
