# Random Circuit Sampling (RCS)

_Random circuit sampling (RCS)_ is studied primarily for its assumed inherent difficulty for a classical computer to execute and sample, as the basis of a number of "quantum supremacy" experiments. Recently, it has been argued that RCS can be used to [certify random number generation](https://www.quantinuum.com/press-releases/quantinuums-quantum-origin-becomes-first-software-quantum-random-number-generator-to-achieve-nist-validation). While Quantinuum's ion trap processors have _all-to-all connectivity_ between qubits, allowing _unstructured_ RCS, which Qrack still finds difficult to simulate, we argue that _structured_ RCS, on most _nearest-neighbor_ connectivity topologies (like Google's Sycamore and Willow processors, since their [2019 "quantum supremacy" experiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5)) are efficiently simulated via the very "patching" and "elision" concepts that Google Quantum AI used to _validate_ their results in the first place, since 2019, generalized as an automatic feature in Qrack as _"automatic circuit elision" (ACE)._ To reproduce our experiment at scales small enough to directly validate against ideal simulation with Qiskit Aer, run [experiment_nn.sh](https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack-examples/blob/main/rcs/experiment_nn.sh), and other scripts in this folder can report how long it takes to run frontier-scale experiments (which cannot be compared to ideal simulation), by simulating the full circuit protocol under stopwatch timing.
